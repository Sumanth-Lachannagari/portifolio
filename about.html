    <h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a <strong>Software Engineer / Python Developer with 3+ years of professional experience</strong>,
      specializing in building clean, efficient, and scalable software solutions.
      I focus on writing maintainable code and designing systems that perform reliably
      in real-world production environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      My core expertise lies in <strong>Python development</strong>, where I work extensively with
      <strong>Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and automation</strong>.
      I have hands-on experience building backend services and REST APIs using
      <strong>Flask and Django frameworks</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with backend engineering, I possess strong analytical skills and practical experience in
      <strong>SQL, Pandas, NumPy, and Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>.
      I have worked on multiple data-driven and machine learning projects,
      including a <strong>Heart Attack Prediction Analysis</strong>,
      applying ML concepts to solve real-world problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am comfortable working across the complete software development lifecycle —
      requirement analysis, system design, development, debugging, optimization,
      and production support. I actively collaborate with cross-functional teams
      to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Backed by industry-recognized certifications from
      <strong>Deloitte Australia, Google, and other platforms</strong>,
      I continuously upskill to stay aligned with modern software engineering standards.
